Purpose of the project
The main purpose of the Journey into Vitality website is to share, share my knowledge and my passion: wellbeing, power of nature, herbs and healthy diatery choices. All of these are something that I have been learning up until now, I share knowledge and experiences that I tested on myself. I believe in nature and I believe that we are all able to heal, to start over and reset our health. My main goal is to help others and bring awarness and choices to the ones that are open to try new things, to people who struggle with their health but also to those who are just lookimg to use what nature has to offer and improve their wellbeing. I believe content I included in my first ever website and I hope that it reaches someone who will use it and benefit from it- this would be my ultimate goal.

Receipes section where users are able to choose from various options: breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks and by adding their own ingredients from suggested list create their own meal. 

5. Design

a. Color scheme

I used simple color scheme to create this website.
The footer colour is in keeping with the pallete yet allow user to distinguish this section from the others on the particular page.

b. Typography
Headings are in Rock Salt and normal text is in Noto Sans.
Rock Salt is handcrafted with felt-tip markers that makes it look personable.
I paired this bold and edgy handwritten font with a web oriented sans-serif font. Both fonts are clean and easily readable, this combination sis frequently used on wellbeling and healt websites
Sans serif is the fallback font in case the chosen font can not be imported correctly.
