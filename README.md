## General Information

The main purpose of the Journey into Vitality website is to share, share my knowledge and my passion: wellbeing, power of nature, herbs and healthy dietary choices. All of these are something that I have been learning up until now, I share knowledge and experiences that I tested on myself. I believe in nature and I believe that we are all able to heal, to start over and reset our health. My main goal is to help others and bring awareness and choices to the ones that are open to try new things, to people who struggle with their health but also to those who are just looking to use what nature has to offer and improve their wellbeing. I believe content I included in my first ever website and I hope that it reaches someone who will use it and benefit from it- this would be my ultimate goal.

## Technologies Used

* CSS3

* HTML5

* GITHUB

* GITPOD

## Features

* I have created a website that is fully responsive on all screen sizes

* Users are able to interact and have the opportunity to chose herbs that might be decsribed in depth in next newsletter.

## Design

* Color scheme

I used simple color scheme to create this website.
The footer color (#DBC2AD) is in keeping with the palette yet allow user to distinguish this section from the others on the particular page.

The same color (#DBC2AD) is used for JOIN US button and SUBMIT button on vote form on main home page. 

* Typography

Headings are in Rock Salt and normal text is in Noto Sans.
Rock Salt is handcrafted with felt-tip markers that makes it look personable.
I paired this bold and edgy handwritten font with a web-oriented sans-serif font. Both fonts are clean and easily readable, this combination sis frequently used on wellbeing and health websites
Sans serif is the fallback font in case the chosen font cannot be imported correctly.

* Icons

I used icons from font awesome, to add visual indicators. Link here: [Font awesome (https://fontawesome.com)]

* Imagery

 Main hero image of green herbs on marble table has been inspiring me to create website that is clean looking and appealing. Website that is showing the beauty of nature- herbs and nutrition.
[The main image of the herbs (www.pinterest.com)]

The main home page includes background image used in the main section. I chose sage green marble wallpaper to make this section pop. [background sage green marble wallpaper background (www.pinterest.com)] The same image is used in Recipes section as a background to the ingredients part.

The recipes section has three images, all of these are inspiring, healthy and appealing:

[Pineapple smoothie from (https://www.evolvingtable.com/tropical-fruit-and-spinach-green-smoothie/)]

[Watermelon smoothie from (https://drkellyann.com/blogs/recipes/cool-watermelon-green-smoothie?_pos=3&_sid=b270fe255&_ss=r)]
